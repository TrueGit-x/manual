Added
-----

* PHP 8.0
* Ruby 3.0
* InfluxDB and ``telegraf``
* PostgreSQL
* CouchDB
* MongoDB
* .NET 5.0
* ``gobject-introspection-devel``, ``pango-devel``, ``ripgrep``, ``bat``,
  ``asciidoc``, ``ledger``

Changed
-------

* legacy URLs like ``adminer.``, ``pma.``, and ``webmail.host.uberspace.de``
  redirect to their global counterparts (e.g. https://webmail.uberspace.de)
* removed PHP 7.2
* removed .NET 2.0 and 2.2
* httpd is now allowed to read files with ``user_home_t`` SELinux labels. This
  fixes usability issues because of files removed from home. It also enables
  CGI scripts to access libraries installied in ``$HOME/.local`` and similar.
  There is still no official support for CGI, though.

Fixed
-----

* tmux sessions no longer break after some time. We mistakenly removed them from
  ``/tmp`` automatically and now leave them be.
* MySQL backups sometimes (1 or 3 databases in total on _all_ hosts) fail, so we
  now retry them once. This increases the reliability of the provided backups
  and silences our monitoring.
* Sieve configuration files no longer show up as folders in mail clients.

Internal
--------

* We migrated additional hosts to SSD storage.
* Add a test for redis.
* Add monitoring check for failed user services. This way we will notice, if
  your supervisord or php-fpm fail.
* Add monitoring check for individual MySQL backups. Monitoring for the backup
  process as a whole was already present.
