Added
-----

* Support for `R <https://www.r-project.org/about.html>`_ and
  `CRAN packages <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_.


Changed
-------

* Increased the **Rspamd** reject score to ``15`` (up from ``10``).

* Reduced the **Rspamd** score for ``INVALID_RCPT_8BIT`` to ``3`` (down from
  ``6``).

* We limit the *Spam Assassin* rules we use with **Rspamd** to
  `ZMI <https://sa.zmi.at/>`_.

* Deprecated **PHP** ``7.2``. It will be removed early next year.

* We added a connection timeout on port 587 (hard capped at two hours, or one
  hour for idle connections). Our SMTP submit queue suffered from lingering
  connections, we hope this helps to mitigate it.

* The output of ``uberspace mail domain add`` now ends domain names with a dot
  (``.``). We hope this helps avoiding situations, where it could otherwise be
  interpreted as *relative to an origin* (this mostly effects c/p to *bind*
  configurations, but also some web based GUIs).

Internal
--------

* We migrated a lot of hosts to SSD storage.

* *fstrim* now runs about weekly on the hosts. Concrete times are distributed
  randomly, to minimize the impact on the cluster.

* While creating SQL backup dumps, we now log and monitor *MariaDB* errors.

* We moved the *Rspamd* logs out of the journal (for now). This allows us to
  have a longer retention policy for those, while still keeping them pretty
  verbose. We will fine tune our Spam filtering over the next releases, so this
  might come in handy.
